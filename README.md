# Projects Java Initiate

Welcome to **Projects Java Initiate**! This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Java projects designed to help new programmers (like me!) practice and master core Java concepts. Each project is built using pure Java (no frameworks like Spring Boot) to focus on fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, and object-oriented programming.

## Purpose
I created this repo to document my learning journey with Java and to share simple, practical projects that other beginners can explore, run, and modify. Whether you're just starting out or brushing up on basics, feel free to dive in!

## Projects Included
Here’s a list of the projects currently in this repository (or planned):

1. **To-Do List Manager**
   - A console-based app to add, view, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
   - Key Concepts: `ArrayList`, loops, user input with `Scanner`, classes.
   - Location: `/todo-list-manager`

2. **Simple Calculator** *(Planned)*
   - A basic calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Key Concepts: Conditionals (`if`/`switch`), methods, `Scanner`.

3. **Guess the Number Game** *(Planned)*
   - A game where you guess a random number with hints.
   - Key Concepts: Loops, `Random` class, basic logic.

4. **Student Grade Tracker** *(Planned)*
   - Track and calculate student grades (average, max, min).
   - Key Concepts: Arrays or `ArrayList`, loops, math operations.

*(More projects to be added as I progress!)*

## How to Run
Each project is standalone and can be run with a Java Development Kit (JDK). Here’s the general process:
1. **Prerequisites:** Install JDK 8 or higher ([Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)).
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wallacemillerdias/projects-java-initiate.git
